Shy dog opens his heart to me<br />
That dog leans on me for the first time<br />

Meeting ends with a feeling of mini breakthrough 

<br /><br /> 

Biking home after a strenuous, sweaty workout, feeling the cool breeze gently brush against my face.

Stumbling upon old photos

<br /><br /> 


Buying a new fineliner,<br /> 
putting screens to sleep, <br /> 
listening to the satisfying sound of a new pen scribbling on paper.<br />
<!-- The satisfying sound of a new pen scribbling on a fresh notebook -->

Re-decorating home <br />
DIYing stuff, reconnecting with the kid in me

![Quote from book]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/post-2024-05-31-book.jpg){:class="img-responsive img-size-large"}
Reading the book a friend had left me. <br /> 
Reading it the second time because there is so much more to be felt. <br />
