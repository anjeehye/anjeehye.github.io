## How the world celebrated my birthday
Illusion of Grandeur? Nah. Rather, appreciation of everyday happenings. Finding patterns where none exist. Putting meaning to randomness. 😉

July 14, 2022 counted 28 years since I was thrown into the world. One of the innumerable days like any other. But the conventional label of a birthday gives me an excuse to notice the small and big things illuminate my life. I'm in the mood of being super appreciative of my life. So, here I list a few of the small and big events that gave an extra glow to this particular point in my timeline.

### Art projects
I noticed I have been being more crafty. Like little Jeehye.
that I started enjoyihng a lot again!

### A little pocket money from my university
Applied for a grant, because, why not. Got approved! Got a small generous amount of €200! For a forever-student soul like me, this actually does mean something. Hoohoo

### Biergarten
with perfect weather and perfect Bier vom fass.

### Belated b-day party 
with the people I admire. Together, having a good time 💛. What more could I ask for!

#### These perfect gift from friends
with the people I admire. Together, having a good time 💛. What more could I ask for!

### (듀듕..) PhD offer 🍾
I reached out to my dream team, we had a meeting, she gave me an offer, and I said, <b>*yes*</b>. 
This was the day before my birthday.
