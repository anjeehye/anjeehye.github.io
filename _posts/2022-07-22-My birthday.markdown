## How the world celebrated my birthday
Illusion Of Grandeur? Nope. 🙅🏻‍♀️ Rather, appreciation of everyday happenings. Finding patterns where none exist. Putting meaning to randomness. 😉

July 14, 2022 counted 28 years since I was thrown into the world. Obviously just another day. But the conventional label of birthdays gave me an excuse to notice some small and big things that made me extra happy. Super appreciative of all that I'm going through. So, here I list a few of the small and big events located around this 'just another day' that gave extra glow to my timeline.

### Art projects
that I started enjoyihng a lot again!

### A little pocket money from my university
Applied for a grant, because, why not. Got approved! Got a small generous amount of €200! For a forever-student soul like me, this actually does mean something. Hoohoo

### Biergarten
with perfect weather and perfect Bier vom fass.

### Belated b-day party 
with the people I admire. Together, having a good time 💛. What more could I ask for!

#### These perfect gift from friends
with the people I admire. Together, having a good time 💛. What more could I ask for!

### (듀듕..) PhD offer 🍾
I reached out to my dream team, we had a meeting, she gave me an offer, and I said, <b>*yes*</b>. 
This was the day before my birthday.
