Monstera pushes out a new leaf<br /> 
<!-- A new leaf unfurls on my Monstera<br /> -->
and it's big!

Shy dog opens his heart to me<br />
That dog leans on me for the first time<br /> 


<br /><br /> 


Meeting ends with a feeling of mini breakthrough

Stumbling upon old photos

<br /><br /> 


Bought a new 0.05 mm fineliner.<br /> 
Put screens to sleep, listening to the sound of a new pen scribbling on paper.<br />
Pouring out thoughts, feeling relief, catharsis.
<!-- The satisfying sound of a new pen scribbling on a fresh notebook -->

<br /><br />

Re-decorating home <br />
DIYing stuff, reconnecting with the kid in me

<br /><br />

Reading the book a friend had left me. <br /> 
Reading it the second time because there is so much more to be felt. <br />
