I might be sort of getting the point of ceremonial occasions. Those that demand you to dress in painfully conventional dresses and sit on an incommodious chair for 4 hours so you could walk across the stage for 10 seconds while your parents desperately (and unsuccessfully) try to take a photo of you from across the gigantic hall. I‚Äôve no longer been an undergraduate since 6 months back. But actually attending the congregation ceremony makes me all sentimental and stuff. 

(Is it the beer, or is it me) So, I am thinking, HKU was honestly not bad. I had gone through what I had to go through. I am proud of how I dealt with the hard times because they were very, very bad. I was sore and vulnerable for so long. Because of that it sometimes seems unreal how well I am doing today.

So why not list here a few of the highlights of the past five years (including the gap year).

## 1 ‚Äì Biggest printed photo of me hung in public

Ahaha. This is awkward. A bit embarrassing. But funny too.

I always knew I‚Äôm better off behind than in front of a camera. But then, during the photoshoot, the photographer was like ‚Äì ‚Äúimagine I am your handsome ‚Äòoppa‚Äò (wait) and we‚Äôre on a picnic under the beautiful sunlight‚Äù (sigh). Thence I doubted my previous conviction. If that‚Äôs what the one behind the camera does‚Ä¶ maybe not that either.

## 2 ‚Äì Life companions
These guys who can sometimes be difficult but never turn down an impromptu beer meetup. üòà And the honest and ludicrous conversations we have during those hours. What more could I ask for?

## 3 ‚Äì I think might know what I want (and this is a milestone)
Some come to uni all seemingly figured out. Me? I was lost for a long time. That is, for most of my uni years, during which I thought I might become a visual artist, a web developer/designer, a clinical psychologist, or once even a professional nomad. Now, I am pretty certain. I am an aspiring brain researcher who is fascinated by human visual perceptual experiences and who is looking forward to learning and applying computational methods to investigate the human mind.

It‚Äôs amazing how things start to make sense. And this did not come through logical thinking or strategic planning. I remained loyal to my gut feelings, and this is where I ended up. (also, am I not an amateur web developer/designer (I built this website), an amateur artist (photographer), and an amateur nomad (if there‚Äôs such a thing)?)

If, dreadfully, I had not been lost, what would I have become?

I remember not understanding a thing about myself. I remember thinking, everyone but me has got their shit together. I recall seriously contemplating dropping out of HKU to go to an art school and pursue my (still not to be found) overwhelming creative desires. I remember applying for a leave-of-absence because I still felt clueless after three years of university education. I had no idea what I liked and disliked, what I wanted to do with my life. I liked a multitude of things, but without ‚Äúsufficient‚Äù passion in any of those. I thought maybe I was born in the wrong era. I clearly recall the uncountable sleepless nights, my head rummaged by hopelessness and anxiety and disappointment at myself. Hoping, praying, I could start all over again. I remember, asking myself hundreds and thousands of times why I cannot be just like everybody else.

We all know we all go through these thoughts at some point in life. But still, you just can‚Äôt help but feel like a loser. Like you‚Äôre all alone.

That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs sometimes hard to believe how much I have changed. It sometimes seems unreal. Because I honestly love who I am, I can‚Äôt express just how much I love my life. There are sudden moments that strike me how grateful I am to be alive. Hard times have indeed made me stronger. And definitely helped uncover my unique, idiosyncratic self. It was a fight-or-flight, and I chose to fight. And when you are fighting against yourself, it‚Äôs either you give up or you win. You do not lose against yourself. You only choose to retreat.

## 4 ‚Äì Also, kinda cool to know my major GPA is the highest of the class.
