# My website moved!

My website moved from wordpress-based site to Github Pages (here).

I moved because:
* small issues kept on popping up with wordpress. I am a self-taught fake developer. Things got a bit confusing :p 
* Github pages is free! No need to pay for hosting / domains.
* Turns out Github Pages are pretty easy to set up. There's also a lot of room for flexibility, which is important to me.

Having lots of fun designing the website! ♥️

Migration is still in progress. I still need to move my posts, 35mm portfolio, and tweak design and functionality here and there.
